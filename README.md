# BigIntLibrary2
Library for working with long numbers (version 2.0)
This library uses the std::vector container. This library is 2.5 times faster than the version 1.0 Big Integer library (https://github.com/DjCrush/BigIntLibrary). 
Values are now stored packed.
The computation speed has increased 60-70 times.
The time of finding the Fibonacci number with the serial number 1,000,000 is about 12 seconds.
